# STOP!

_May 30, 2013_

We have stopped working on the Master branch. All work is
continuing on the Static branch for now. Two reasons:

1. Updates to Master get deployed immediately to www.msrd.io

2. Static gets 'compiled' into a release folder, which will eventually
   get deployed to Azure. But we haven't figured that out yet.


Technical details about the RD site
-----------------------------------
- HTML5 and CSS3, naturally
- Hosted on Azure as part of their preview "web site"
- Node.js and Express for minimal routing and layout engine
- Content marked up as Jade (HTML), Stylus (CSS) and Markdown (text)
- No client-side Javascript (yet)
- Git for source control; change sets pushed to Azure via `git push`
- Source will be on [github](http://github.com)

Getting Started
---------------
 - `npm install`
 - `npm install -g bower` <-- Installs the [Bower](http://bower.io) client side package manager
 - `bower install` <-- Brings in local copies of needed dependencies (ex: `jquery`)
 - `grunt` <-- Builds/Compiles/MagicStuff and launches browser to test site


Stretch goals for the site
--------------------------

- [Clean typography][1]
- [Semantic markup][2]
- [Grid-based layouts][3]
- [Mobile-first adaptive design][4]
- [Design âˆ© Engineering][5]
- [EMs over Pixels][6]
- [Engineered HTTP for speed][7]
